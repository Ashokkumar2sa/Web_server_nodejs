# Web_server_nodejs

A basic web server made using Node-JS ans Express JS.

We will keep our data in  a JSON file ( couls also maitain a hardcoded data in file itself).

And when a user makes a request to our server we provide the data to him as number of coin he has .

The project directory check is built upon the above base files and is somewhat better.
The check folder has a server.js ( Do work of a server ) that respond to the request of fetch.js that request data from user and then the fetch.js make a request to server.js which returns the desired outcome in the console and can be used for oter applications.
